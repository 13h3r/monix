# Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

Rename these packages in your imports:

- `monifu.reactive`: `monix.reactive`
- `monifu.concurrent`: `monix.execution`

Important classes that were moved and that aren't
solved by the above renames:

- `monifu.reactive.Ack`: `monix.execution.Ack`
- `monifu.reactive.Subscriber`: `monix.reactive.observers.Subscriber`
- `monifu.concurrent.Implicits.globalScheduler`: `monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global`

The operators `combineLatest` and `zip` are no longer
overridden based on the number of parameters. Instead we expose
`Observable.combineLatest2`, `Observable.zip2` and `Observable.zipWith2` for 2 parameters,
`Observable.combineLatest3`, `Observable.zip3` and `Observable.zipWith3` for 3 parameters,
and so on for up to 6 parameters. If you want more than that,
there's always `Observable.zipList` and `Observable.combineLatestList`.

The `Channel` has been renamed to `ConcurrentSubject`. And also
`OverflowStrategy` now has a type parameter. So instead of:

```scala
import monifu.reactive.OverflowStrategy.Synchronous
import monifu.reactive.channels.PublishChannel

val os: Synchronous = ???
val channel = PublishChannel[String](strategy)
```

You need to do:

```scala
import monix.reactive.OverflowStrategy.Synchronous
import monix.reactive.subjects.ConcurrentSubject

val os: Synchronous[String] = ???
val channel = ConcurrentSubject.publish[String](os)
```
